#this is implementation using pigpio
#first remember to install all the things as mentioned in the pigpio github page and 
#also start the pigpiod daemon as instructed in the raspberry pi helper forum

#now the following lines of code are required to start the pigpio process

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 
import struct 
import os


GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

pi = pigio.pi()              # use defaults
pi = pigpio.pi('mypi')       # specify host, default port
pi = pigpio.pi('mypi', 7777) # specify host and port and default port 

pi = pigpio.pi()             # exit script if no connection
if not pi.connected:
   exit()


pi.set_mode( 4, pigpio.INPUT)  # GPIO  4 as input
pi.set_mode(17, pigpio.OUTPUT) # GPIO 17 as output
pi.set_mode(24, pigpio.ALT2)   # GPIO 24 as ALT2

#to read we have to do
pi.read(4)

#to write we have to do
pi.write(17,0)
pi.write(17,1)


#this is to stop the pigpio process
pi.stop()
